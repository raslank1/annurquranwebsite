<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Below is some feedback from a student.</p>
<img src="feedback.jpg">
<p>I personally had also taken classes with the sheikh and had benefitted greatly.</p>
<p>He taught me many subjects, specifically Quran memorization, tajweed, Arabic and Aqeedah.</p>
<p>He explained things clearly and he would always ask to make sure I understood.</p>
<p>If for some reason he had to delay a class, he would always ask me a while before to make sure.</p>
<p>May Allah perserve and protect him.</p>
